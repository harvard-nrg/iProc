# iProc - individualized fMRI preprocessing pipeline
------------------------------------------------
Many human neuroimaging practices rely on combining measurements from many people in order to obtain statistical power. This approach collapses meaningful variation within each individual. iProc is designed to preprocess and combine data from a deeply-sampled *individual* brains, building statistical power by combining multiple scans from the same individual.

# NOTES
This is v2.6, the branch J is working on to incorporate multi-echo, STAR's topup and BIDS, and LR fieldmaps.
